# Manifesting âœ¨

I'd like to make the following happen, so I'm going to say it out loud. If it's within your power to help me, then please let me know.

\(All wishes in present tense for ultra manifesting powerz.\)

1. I'm a steward of a beautiful **land** in Pico Island \(or New Zealand\), with a forest and an ocean view. I live in a peaceful tiny house, get my food almost entirely from the food forest, and put my heart into catalyzing a beautiful community.
2. I'm being gifted a **sailboat**. Buying stuff is oldschool. There's so much abundance in the world, and I'm sure there is a sailboat out there that awaits me, so we can co-create transformational experiences for people.
3. I'm co-running a **performing** **arts & events company** in Pico with my close friends. We're using art as a language and reach the souls of locals \(natives and expats\) and travelers in this wonderful place.

If you feel the calling to support my work and **send some financial energy my way**, you certainly can:
