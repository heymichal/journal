# Moments of Connection

"Moments of Connection" is my attempt at wrapping in words these magical moments when everything make sense and you feel connected with the Universe \(whatever that means\). They are powerful, and precious. And they are also my creative fuel.  
  
I've decided to embark on a [_Create 100 Challenge_ ](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1362123101983576064)by Visa Veerasamy, and publish a whole hundred of them. I'm documenting my process in this [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/michalkorzonek/status/1398284818698407943).
