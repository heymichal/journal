# Free Dance Movement

I‚Äôm not a dancer.

But **I am a juggler, and dancing is the ultimate juggling experience**. It requires no extra equipment and no prep‚Äìjust a little bit of space, and \(ideally\) some music. I can roll with that.

Dancing makes me feel free in my body.

It makes me feel connected.

And it‚Äôs so much fun.

There‚Äôs nothing quite like a **3-minute dancing break** to get unstuck from a problem I‚Äôm facing at work. I purposefully make it ‚Äùtiny‚Äù \(just one song\) to reduce the resistance of starting. And I put zero pressure on making it pretty. I move as my body feels like. Sometimes it looks as a low-budget kung-fu movie. Sometimes it looks like I‚Äôm having a seizure. And sometimes it looks like a weird crossover of [Butoh dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ms7MGs2Nh8) with traditional [Polish folk dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NetnbP4E04). I don‚Äôt care. 

The thing is: the second I start to dance the ‚Äúdots‚Äù connect in my head, and the problem I‚Äôm facing solves itself. All I need to do is move my body.
