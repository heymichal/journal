[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is one of my favourite digital tools, and I use it for most of my writing. 

However, until now, my documentation projects have been written partially in Obsidian and partially directly on [Gitbook](https://gitbook.com). While I love working with Gitbook, this is not a very robust solution (no data backup), and since Gitbook doesn't have an offline mode, I need an internet connection to work on my documentation. This is not ideal, as I'd like to move more towards being offline.

A workaround I want to explore, is to find a way to connect Obsidian with Gitbook, so I can edit my documentation offline in Obsidian, and then push changes to Gitbook whenever I have connection.

## How to do it

### 1. Create a repository in Github

### 2. Connect Gitbook with Github

### 3. Sync Github repo with Github Desktop

### 4. Open folder as vault in Obsidian

## Caviats
### Markdown is different

### Hidden folders
Assets, Images, How to sho on Mac (Cmd + Shift + .)
