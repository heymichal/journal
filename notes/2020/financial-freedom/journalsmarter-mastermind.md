# JournalSmarter Mastermind ðŸ§ 

In many ways JournalSmarter Mastermind resembles one of other [microsolidarity experiments](../../microsolidarity-experiment.md) I'm involved with.

The key difference is that it's a **paid experience** open to the most committed students of JournalSmarter courses, facilitated by Silvia and myself. 

I guess you can think of it as a premium group coaching experience, for a group of 5 people.
