# \#Nature

I resonate more with this:

and this:

than this:

Call me crazy.

During my yearly review I've set a goal of spending more days in nature than in the city. So far I'm doing very well on thatâ€”I arrived to Pico Island just before Corona lockdowns started in Europe, and as for today \(12th of May\) there are no flights or ships available to get out of here.

Not that I want to leave anyway.
