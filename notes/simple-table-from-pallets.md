# Simple table from pallets

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a part of my [Forest Log üå≥](forest-log.md).
{% endhint %}

Materials: 3 pallets \(ideally of the same kind\) per table.   
Building time: 30m   
Skills required: null  
Tools required: null \(although a hammer and nails would allow to secure it better\)

![2 tables combined \(6 pallets total\)](../.gitbook/assets/img_20210813_140229.jpg)

### MVP Instructions

1. Level the ground
2. Place pallets for legs, make sure they are even
3. Place the table surface pallet on top \(sliding works well\)
4. Optional: secure by nailing an additional piece of wood connecting the legs together

The surface under the table can be used as storage:
