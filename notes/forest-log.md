# Forest Log üå≥

üå≥

**At the end of June I sensed a Call**.

It was a kind of deep feeling, a glimpse of intuition, telling me quite clearly to move into a forest. The idea resonated with me and the timing was perfect: it's summer time and I had to move out of my house anyway. But, I didn't answer the call and moved to another house.

But the Call was getting stronger and eventually it was not possible for me to not honour it.

So I ditched the comfort of living in a house and moved into a forest. Here's my Forest Log, documenting the process.

### Day 1: Leaving the house

The idea is to use my car as storage and camp in a tent + hammock wherever I feel like. This way I can have different spaces in the campsite and also can have guests.

**üëÅ Insights:** There is no way of optimising the space / equipment before living the experience. I packed way too many things, and it's all kinda awkward, but I'm ok with it. I'll naturally optimize, as I realise what I need.

The first day I have a friend visiting Pico. I take them around to explore. In the evening we set camp in a public, yet secluded site in a magical forest. There's a nearby swimming spot, a shower, a toilet and a pop-up bar. The car + campsite combo works well.

We end up sleeping under the stars next to the fire, watching a meteor shower.

My friend shows me a ceremonial way of starting a fire, using only a match, wood and palo santo.

### Day 2: Chilling in the camp

After a day of moving around my friend and I spend most of the day in the forest. Swimming, being, reading, chilling. Life is good.

I sleep in a hammock and they sleep in a tent, as the weather is unclear and there are occasional light showers. More meteor showers in the evening. It's mindblowing.

Since my car and equipment is not optimized yet, I find it hard to keep things tidy, especially with another person.

### Day 3: On Public Spaces

I go for a day of sailing. When I come back my friend is gone already and the only thing I dream of is to go to sleep in my peaceful tent.

But the campsite has a big and loud party going on. Then there's a jeep full of drunken loud people, who after asking for beers, say that they will be back.

That's my cue to leave.

It's dark and I'm too tired to look for a spot and pitch a hammock. I decide to sleep in a car. It's a bit of a pain, because it's not optimized for this, but after a moment of moving things around I find a comfortable way to do it. It's actually quite a nice night and the place is super peaceful and quiet.

**üëÅ Insights:** Public spaces are great, and I do think that being exposed to other ways of enjoying time in nature is ultimately a good thing \(diversity, ftw!\). But I feel like I need peace and quiet, at the moment.

### Day 4: Moving In

I'm moving into a forest belonging to my friend.

This will be the first time where I'm going to be living in a forest for a longer period of time \(or it seems so\), not in a camping context.

I pick the spot at the very edge of the land, the furthest away from his house and right next to the ocean. I can feel the magic. A good friend is moving in with me, a few hundred meters away.

There's outdoors kitchen, electricity plug, water source in my friends place. My car also stays up there, as the path is not possible to drive on. Since I was planning to use my car as storage, not having it next to the site changes things a lot. My tent will have to store things, which in turn limits my living space.

II think I cought a cold during my sailing day, and I feel low energy. I pick a spot, pitch a tent and sink into the forest.

### Day 5: Sleep and Recovery

I still feel tired. I pitch my hammock and start cleaning the space. I spend a lot of the day sleeping.

I go to my forest neighbour to make a big pot of ginger + lemon + cayenne tea to heal myself. I boost a few cups with a bit of raw garlic for extra healing powerz.

### Day 6: Recovery and Forest Charging

I'm feeling much better today.

I start making the space: building the firespace, a bench, doing some cleaning, placing candles, and generally speaking landing into my new home.

I spend a lot of time just being in the forest. It's incredible: I can feel a very tangible physical sensation of healing every time I just lay down on the ground.

It's a magical place.

During the day I draw the Hermit from the Tarot deck. Not surprising at all üòÇ.

Before going to bed, I spend some time lying on the ground and watching the trees and stars.

## Day 7: First Guests

I wake up feeling a crazy amount of energy. I guess the lemon+ginger+cayenne combined with some forest bathing is the best medicine for me.

I make a coffee on a camping gas stove of my friend, and make a song.

I go on a mission to drop some stuff I don't need, and find things I do need for the campsite. I come back with a lot of new items and ideas. The main problem is storage: my things are not organized at all, and I really need some outside storage solution. I know that a big rain is coming in two days, so it needs to be waterproof, too.

I build the fire, set it up for cooking, and have my first guest over.

**‚≠êÔ∏è Achievement:** I light the fire with a lighter, candle and wood. No chemicals or paper. It takes me a while, but it feels extremely rewarding.

We connect by the fire, share about our current life chapters and intentions we'd like to manifest. It feels special to be holding this space, especially since my guests are 25-27 yo and seem very receptive and curious about nature. Who knows what seeds I'm helping them plant? üå±

**‚≠êÔ∏è Achievement:** My guests are Portuguese. We speak in English, but I decide to share some profound things in Portuguese to practice speaking. I still can't follow deep conversations with numerous native speakers, but speaking is already a great practice.

**üëÅ Insights:** I realise that my tent is not very well positioned. My firespace also need more work. That's okay: as planned, I'm figuring out the best way of arranging things as I live my forest life. There is no other way.

Oh, and the friend who owns the land gave me permission to build some semi-permanent structures, so now I just need to get the materials and start building.

Again, before going to sleep, I spend some time lying under the trees and stars and sinking into the ground. And for the first time I sleep in a hammock.At the end of June I felt a calling in my heart telling me to move
